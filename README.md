# Community-GIS-mapping
## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and methodology for mapping health-related facilities in three urban informal settlements in Dhaka City: Kallayanpur, Dholpur, and Shyampur. The project uses interactive maps to visualize and communicate data about these settlements, including health care facilities, water collection points, sanitation, and more. Interactive maps, created using the R programming language, are used to make findings accessible and user-friendly. The repository demonstrates the potential of geocomputation to describe and change urban landscapes through data visualization.
